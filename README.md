# MONITO 
    This app helps you to choose the movie that you want to watch

# Description
This application helps pople to find out upcoming movies, new releases and details of choosen movie. 
This time I used React in typescript for creating Monito because it's most popular these days programming language and it's easy to use and helps you figure out how to make usefull application. 
I used typescript because it helps us know exactly what type of variables we use.
Since this is my first project in react I have been faced with a lot of challenges but Server-side rendering is the hardest part of this and I hope I will implement it in the near future.

Some of the features which are included in this app are: 
    - local storage  - where you can save movies which you like
    - redux state managemen
    - infinity scroll (lazy loading)
    - sidebar menu 
    - slider 
    - search (by name of the movie)
    - sorting (by title and year of release)(asc, dsc)
    - filtering (by vote and year of release)
 
 For UI framework i didn't use anything because I wanted to learn from scratch so I used SASS/SCSS
 
 # packages 
 
    - offcanvas
    - nuke slider
    - infinity scroll
    - react-redux
